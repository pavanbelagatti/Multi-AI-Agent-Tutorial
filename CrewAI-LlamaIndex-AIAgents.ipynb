It’s really about being judicious where to lean in and where to pull back. In essence, it’s about protecting one’s capability to innovate and propel forward while being deeply disciplined when it comes to operations. Digitally transformed companies have a distinct advantage here. They can drive frictionless business throughout the supply chain, serve customers at lower costs, and avoid resource-intensive IT upgrades, unlike the digitally disadvantaged who may have to wait for economic conditions to improve before they can make progress.\\nAdvanced technologies – especially AI in tandem with \\ncloud – are creating performance opportunities that are reshaping these dynamics in significant ways. They are helping companies to amplify human potential to take on higher value work, boost people productivity and rapidly create business value. From unlocking efficiencies at scale and empowering the ecosystem to accelerating growth, cognitively capable companies are unshackling intelligence from data for experimentation as well as the scale-out of AI to power greater efficacy and create disruptive revenue streams. \\nInfosys is taking the AI-first approach to its own \\ntransformation. We are bringing the power of AI, analytics, and cloud to accelerate our own enterprise transformation, even as we build incremental value from micro-changes, to improve client service, reimagine business processes, and boost productivity.
